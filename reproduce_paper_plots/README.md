# Reproduce the paper plots/tables/numbers

To exact reproduce the results in the paper, please first refer to the instruction in `../dardel/README.md` to see how to run the experiments. Then, after all the experiments are done, simply run any of the Python script in this folder to produce the result.

The scripts are:

- `plot_benes_bernoulli_errs_and_times.py`. This plots Figure 4.
- `plot_benes_bernoulli_estimation.py`. This plots Figure 5. **You can run this file directly without running the experiments in `../dardel`**. 
- `plot_convergence.py`. This plots Figure 3.
- `plot_parameter_estimation.py`. This plots Figure 6.
- `plot_prey_predator_errs.py`. This plots Figure 7.
- `plot_prey_predator_estimation.py`. This plots a demonstration of the prey-predator experiment. **You can run this file directly without running the experiments in `../dardel`**. 
- `plot_quadrature_rules.py`. This plots Figure 1.
- `plot_quadrature_rules_2d.py`. This plots Figure 2.
